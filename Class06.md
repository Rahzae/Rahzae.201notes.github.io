# Object literals
Objects group together a set of and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. 

```
var hotel = {
name: = `Quay`,
rooms: 40,
booked 25,
gym: true,
rooTypes: [`twin`, 'double', 'suite'],
checkFunction: function() {
return this.rooms - this.booked;
}
}
```

# DOM
Document object model specifies how browsers should create a model of an html page and javascript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
```

```
