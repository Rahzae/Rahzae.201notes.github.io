# CSS Layout
*Css treats each html element as if it is in its own box. this box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.*
Block-level boxes start ona new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the wdth of the boxes. to seperate the boxes you can use boarders, margins, padding, and background colors.
