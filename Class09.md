# Forms
A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server. the name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.

# List Tables and Forms
List markers can be given different appearences using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
Forms are easier to use if the the form controls are vertically aligned using Css.

# Events 
HTML elements nest inside other elements. if you hover or click on a link, you will also be hovering or clicking on its parent elements.
the flow of events only really matters when your code has event handlers on an element and of its ancestor or descendent elements.
