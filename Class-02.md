Structual elements you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

## How Css works, The rules and how to apply

Css treats each element as if its in its own box, allows you to create rules that control how each box is presented. Css rules contain a selector and declaration.
And declarations come in property and value parts.
```
Selector
     H1 {
         font-family: arial; }
            Declaration
```

## Basic Javascript

Before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it.
```
Keyword
  VAR     =    PIZZA
            Variable Name
```

## Decisions
```
   Condition
if (points > 40) {
  console.log('You passed!');
  } else {
  console.log('Try again...');
  }
```
