# Error Handling and Debugging

## The Stack
The JavaScript interpreter processes one line of code at a time.
When a statment needs data from another function, it stacks (or piles) the new function on top of the current task. When a statement has to call some other code in order to do its job, the new task goes to the top of the pile of things to do. 
once the new task has been performed, the interpreter can go back to the task in hand.
